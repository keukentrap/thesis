\subsection{characteristics of a malware binary}
All binaries have a certain design-goal in mind, a task they should execute.\
This also holds with malware, only their goal is of malicious intent.
But Malware does not want to show its goal in order to evade detection from anti-virus, malware-detection and the victim.
It could therefore disguise as an ordinary binary to trick the victim.

Anti-virus software has multiple known strategies to detect malicious intent.
First of all, the most simple aproach, is to check the signature hash of a sample and look up in a database wether it is a known malware sample. 
This approach can be easily mitigated by adding randomized useless data in your binary. (ref)
Second of all, a more sofisticated approach is to detect malware from the order of system calls a sample makes to detect malicious intent. (ref)
This can be bypassed by adding noise in terms of nonsense system calls.
Third of all, Anti-virus scanners perform heuristics to identify suspicious characteristics. Even this can be mitigated by for example packing the binary or encrypting the suspicious parts of your code.

As we can see, there are a lot of tactics to prevent being discovered.
These tactics can be implemented in multiply depending on the preference of the programmer or group. This means that the same traits in malware samples can be linked together. 
Even more simple traits, like comments or variable names in code may reveal the language of the programmer. Also each malware is not written from scratch, most of the times it is build from older code from previous malware. This means that charasteristics resonate in previous work of a hacker group or country.

The design goal of a piece of malware is also important for the end-result of the binary. What is the target? What OS is it meant for? For What should it hide?
What is the goal? Information retreival? Disruption? Gaining control?

These tactics start to reach a great level of sophistication. These solution can be sold on a black market and may be used by other parties.
